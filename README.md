## Project Introduction

This is the `jupyter lab` project of `Fair Logistic Regression (Fair-LR)`, a binary prediction model based on the Seldonian framework of Thomas et al., (2019). There are two notebook files: `fair_lr` and `third_party_implementation`. The `fair_lr` file is the main file of our LAK paper in 2021, where we implemented the fair logistics regression from our own understandings on Seldonian. The `third_party_implementation` includes a later implementation from a student, [Abdul Hannan](https://github.com/hannanabdul55/seldonian-fairness), from UMass, the institute where the authors of Seldonian Framework are from.
